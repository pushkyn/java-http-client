4. On the command line, execute `docker login` and provide your credentials.

# Info

This Docker image contains
 - `java-http-client`
 - Stoplight's Prism, which lets you try out the API without actually sending email

Run it in interactive mode with `-it`.

You can mount repositories in the `/mnt/java-http-client` and `/mnt/java-http-client` directories to use them instead of the default SendGrid libraries. Read on for more info.
